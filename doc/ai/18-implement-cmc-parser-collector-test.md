# Issue 18: Implement @CmcParserCollector.java test

In this `crypto-scout-collector` project we are going to implement the @CmcParserCollectorTest.java test service by
cover the application logic of @CmcParserCollector.java with tests.

## Roles

Take the following roles:

- Expert java engineer.

## Conditions

- Rely on the following implementation: @BybitParserCollectorTest.java.
- Use the `PodmanCompose` service to manage containers as it has been used in: @BybitParserCollectorTest.java.
- Use the `BybitMockData` service to manage containers as it has been used in: @BybitParserCollectorTest.java. 
- Use the `DBUtils` service to manage containers as it has been used in: @BybitParserCollectorTest.java.
- Double-check your proposal and make sure that they are correct and haven't missed any important points.
- Implementation must be production ready.

## Constraints

- Use the best practices and design patterns.
- Use the current technological stack, that's: `ActiveJ 6.0`, `Java 25`, `maven 3.9.1`, `podman 5.6.2`,
  `podman-compose 1.5.0`, `timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg17`, `JUnit 5.13.4`.
- Do not hallucinate.

## Tasks

- As the `expert java engineer` review the current @CmcParserCollector.java implementation in `crypto-scout-collector`
  project and update @CmcParserCollectorTest.java by implementing tests methods to cover logic in the
  @CmcParserCollector.java, use @BybitParserCollectorTest.java as an example.
- As the `expert java engineer` Double-check your proposal and make sure that they are correct and haven't missed any
  important points.
