# Issue 16: Implement @BybitParserCollector.java test

In this `crypto-scout-collector` project we are going to implement the @BybitParserCollectorTest.java test service by
cover the application logic of @BybitParserCollector.java with tests.

## Roles

Take the following roles:

- Expert java engineer.

## Conditions

- Rely on the following implementations: @BybitLinearRepositoryTest.java, @BybitSpotRepositoryTest.java,
  @StreamOffsetsRepositoryTest.java, @BybitParserRepositoryTest.java.
- Use the `PodmanCompose` service to manage containers as it has been used in: @BybitLinearRepositoryTest.java,
  @BybitSpotRepositoryTest.java, @StreamOffsetsRepositoryTest.java, @BybitParserRepositoryTest.java.
- Use the `BybitMockData` service to manage containers as it has been used in: @BybitLinearRepositoryTest.java,
  @BybitSpotRepositoryTest.java, @StreamOffsetsRepositoryTest.java, @BybitParserRepositoryTest.java. 
- Use the `DBUtils` service to manage containers as it has been used in: @BybitLinearRepositoryTest.java,
  @BybitSpotRepositoryTest.java, @StreamOffsetsRepositoryTest.java, @BybitParserRepositoryTest.java.
- Double-check your proposal and make sure that they are correct and haven't missed any important points.
- Implementation must be production ready.

## Constraints

- Use the best practices and design patterns.
- Use the current technological stack, that's: `ActiveJ 6.0`, `Java 25`, `maven 3.9.1`, `podman 5.6.2`,
  `podman-compose 1.5.0`, `timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg17`, `JUnit 5.13.4`.
- Do not hallucinate.

## Tasks

- As the `expert java engineer` review the current @BybitParserCollector.java implementation in `crypto-scout-collector`
  project and update @BybitParserCollectorTest.java by implementing tests methods to cover logic in the
  @BybitParserCollector.java, use @BybitLinearRepositoryTest.java, @BybitSpotRepositoryTest.java,
  @StreamOffsetsRepositoryTest.java, @BybitParserRepositoryTest.java as examples.
- As the `expert java engineer` Double-check your proposal and make sure that they are correct and haven't missed any
  important points.
